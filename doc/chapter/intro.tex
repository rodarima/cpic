\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

It may be surprising to find out that the most common state of matter is plasma 
when we look at the universe. A plasma is an ionized gas consisting of ions and
free electrons distributed over a region in space.
in which at least one electron 
of the atom is separated, so it remains positively charged (ionized) 
\cite{chen}.  Usually this happens in the vacuum

The structure of the document follows the diagram shown in the 
figure~\ref{fig:structure}. In chapter~\ref{ch:intro}, plasma is described as a 
physical phenomenon and we focus on the relevant properties that we want to 
study, from which we derive a mathematical model.  In 
chapter~\ref{ch:plasma-sim} and~\ref{sec:test}. The discretization of the 
mathematical model allows the computer simulation by using numerical algorithms.
