\chapter{Caveats and limitations}

Here is a list of things that are not implemented in the simulator, but may be 
added in a future work.

\begin{itemize}
\item More than 2 dimensions
\item Fully electromagnetic simulation
\item Relativistic particle movement
\item Heterogeneous architecture (GPU+CPU...)
\item Energy conserving codes
\item Visualization of big simulations (paraview)
\item Replace simulation units, so we avoid factor multiplications
\item Other interpolation methods (reduce noise at computational cost)
\end{itemize}
%
Caveats that need to be fixed
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow to specify plasma frequency
\item Validation with other simulation codes
\end{itemize}
