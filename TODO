- Numerical heating shows increasing total energy.
- Particles exceed speed of light happily.
- Ensure plasma frequency matches the analytical value.
- Restrict L <= Debye length
- Fix electrostatic energy units
- Test other field solvers for E
- Merge J into E update
- Fix frontier bug with few blocks
- Add plot of histogram of velocity moments
- Search for 2D cases for study
- Distribution of initial temperature
- Fix error in computation of phi
- Ensure no memleaks in particle comm

OmpSs:

- Include the posibility to define labels which are defined at runtime, so I can
  use any text, possibly with an index

- Let the user assert that a specific task is running/not running
